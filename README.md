# Smart Inventory Management System

## Getting Started

The Smart Inventory Management System is a platform designed to help businesses manage inventory, track stock levels, and generate reports with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for warehouse managers, staff, and auditors. It leverages AI for demand forecasting and anomaly detection, built using `Next.js`, and `MySQL`. The system is scoped for medium to large retail, manufacturing, or logistics companies. Below is a comprehensive outline of all use cases, categorized by user roles and system functionalities, aligning with the projectâ€™s scope and avoiding overlap with e-learning systems.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
